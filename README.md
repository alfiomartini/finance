# Abstract

This is a web application with which one can manage portfolios of stocks. It is implemented with _HTML/CSS/Bootstrap_, _JavaScript_, _Python_, _Flask_ and the _SQLite_ database. It allows
for 'buying' and 'selling' of stocks, and also checking real stock's prices and portfolios's values using the free api provided by IEX cloud. It can also display all user transactions,  as well as generating charts showing stock prices fluctuations for different periods of time. It is an extended version of my original implementation  to a Harvard's CS50 project.
