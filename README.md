# Abstract

This is a web application with which one can manage portfolios of stocks. It is implemented with _HTML/CSS/Bootstrap_, _JavaScript_, _Python_, _Flask_ and the _SQLite_ database. It allows for 'buying' and 'selling' of stocks, and also checking real stock prices and portfolio values using the free API provided by IEX cloud. It can also display all user transactions, as well as generating charts showing stock price fluctuations for different periods of time. You can see it live [here](https://iexstocks.herokuapp.com/).
