# Abstract

This is a web application with which one can manage portfolios of stocks. It allows
for 'buying' and 'selling' of stocks, and also checking real stock's prices and portfolios's values using an external api provided by IEX cloud. It can also display a table summarizing all user transactions, listing every buy and every sell. It is my implementation to one of the Harvard's CS50 Web Track. The frontend is implemented with _HTML/CSS/Bootstrap_, _javascrit_ and _jQuery_, while the backend (server) is coded with _Python_, _Flask_ and the _Sqlite_ database.
